## Note for myself

Before doing a new release*, don't forget to
1. Change the version of the lib in the README
2. Change the version in the package.json
3. rerun `sass --watch source/artemis.scss artemis.css `
4. minify the css of `artemis.css` and copy past it in `artemis.min.css` 


Once those previous steps are done.
1.Go to github and create the realese with some notes of what have change
2. Publish the package on NPM


Note:

*new release: create the release on github and then publishing on npm
